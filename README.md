**Implementation of Perceptron Learning Algorithm, gradient descent algorithm for linear regression, and various Machine Learning tools from SKLearn**

skLearnGridSearch takes a while to run, its grid searching a range of parameters for 7 classifiers:

    3 Support vector machines, linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels
    K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier
    Logistic Regression Classifier
    Random Forest Classifier
    Decision Tree Classifier
